Flipkart Product Sales Analysis (EDA & Visualization)
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Flipkart-like e-commerce dataset to uncover insights related to pricing, discounts, sales performance, delivery efficiency, and customer ratings.
The analysis helps understand how discounts, ratings, and logistics impact final price and units sold, and presents insights using Tableau visualizations.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze the impact of discount percentage on final price

Study the relationship between product ratings and units sold

Compare delivery days across seller cities

Identify brand-wise discount patterns

Build an interactive Tableau dashboard for business insights

🔍 Key Insights

Higher discounts significantly reduce final price but do not always increase units sold.

Products with ratings above 4.0 generally show better sales performance.

Delivery times are mostly consistent across cities, with a median of around 5–6 days.

Some brands rely heavily on discounts, while others maintain premium pricing.

💡 Recommendations

Use moderate discounts (10–20%) to balance profitability and sales volume.

Focus on improving product ratings to drive organic sales growth.

Optimize logistics for cities with higher delivery variability.

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how EDA combined with Tableau dashboards can convert raw e-commerce data into actionable business insights.
It highlights pricing strategy, customer behavior, and delivery efficiency—key areas for decision-making in online retail.
